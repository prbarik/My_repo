Steps -

>> kubectl create -f rhel.yml 

deployment.apps "rhel7-deployment" created

>> kubectl get pods

NAME                             READY   STATUS           RESTARTS AGE
rhel7-deployment-9cb4cf99b-vc5gx 0/1     CrashLoopBackOff 3        1m

>> kubectl logs rhel7-deployment-9cb4cf99b-vc5gx

Hello Kubernetes!


Running the same logs command multiple times, will show: 

Hello Kubernetes!
Hello Kubernetes!
Hello Kubernetes!

That is because the yml was defined to execute the command in a loop. And that is to keep the container alive (to prevent the CrashLoopBackOff and restarting of the container).

Some other useful commands:


kubectl describe pod rhel7-deployment-9cb4cf99b-vc5gx

  

Will give all the details about the pod.

  

kubectl delete deployment rhel7-deployment

Will delete the deployment

  

kubectl delete pod rhel7-deployment-9cb4cf99b-vc5gx

Will delete the pod
