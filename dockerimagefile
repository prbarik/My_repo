What is an Image in Docker?  

If you want to build or run Docker containers, the first thing that needs to be done is to create a Docker image.

A Docker Image is the template (application plus required binaries and libraries) needed to build a running Docker Container (the running instance of that image). That essentially means the application which you want to containerize has to be bundled into a Docker engine understandable layout, along with the required dependencies, including the Operating System, runtime engine that will run the application (eg: java JRE). And the final bundle is what is known as the Image, which can then be used to run the container (with application running inside it)

Docker engine can build images by reading instructions from a text file named "Dockerfile". This file contains all the commands that are required to assemble an image. More details about Dockerfile constructs and how to write a Dockerfile can be found here and some of the best practices here
